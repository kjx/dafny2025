title = {Semantics Engineering with PLT Redex},
year = {2009},
isbn = {0262062755},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {This text is the first comprehensive presentation of reduction semantics in one volume; it also introduces the first reliable and easy-to-use tool set for such forms of semantics. Software engineers have long known that automatic tool support is critical for rapid prototyping and modeling, and this book is addressed to the working semantics engineer (graduate student or professional language designer). The book comes with a prototyping tool suite to develop, explore, test, debug, and publish semantic models of programming languages. With PLT Redex, semanticists can formulate models as grammars and reduction models on their computers with the ease of paper and pencil. The text first presents a framework for the formulation of language models, focusing on equational calculi and abstract machines, then introduces PLT Redex, a suite of software tools for expressing these models as PLT Redex models. Finally, experts describe a range of models formulated in Redex. PLT Redex comes with the PLT Scheme implementation, available free at http://www.plt-scheme.org/. Readers can download the software and experiment with Redex as they work their way through the book. For more information (including the preface, a sample syllabus, and a quick introduction to Redex), see the Redex website at http://redex.plt-scheme.org/. Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, and Matthew Flatt are the authors (with Shiram Krishnamurthi) of How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing, also published by the MIT Press.}

abstract = "Any non-trivial concurrent system warrants synchronisation, regardless of the concurrency model. Actor-based concurrency serialises all computations in an actor through asynchronous message passing. In contrast, lock-based concurrency serialises some computations by following a lock–unlock protocol for accessing certain data. Both systems require sound reasoning about pointers and aliasing to exclude data-races. If actor isolation is broken, so is the single-thread-of-control abstraction. Similarly for locks, if a datum is accessible outside of the scope of the lock, the datum is not governed by the lock. In this paper we discuss how to balance aliasing and synchronisation. In previous work, we defined a type system that guarantees data-race freedom of actor-based concurrency and lock-based concurrency. This paper extends this work by the introduction of two programming constructs; one for decoupling isolation and synchronisation and one for constructing higher-level atomicity guarantees from lower-level synchronisation. We focus predominantly on actors, and in particular the Encore programming language, but our ultimate goal is to define our constructs in such a way theat they can be used both with locks and actors, given that combinations of both models occur frequently in actual systems. We discuss the design space, provide several formalisations of different semantics and discuss their properties, and connect them to case studies showing how our proposed constructs can be useful. We also report on an on-going implementation of our proposed constructs in Encore."

@inproceedings{JSVAts,
  abstract = {Communicating Event-Loop Languages similar to E and AmbientTalk are recently gaining more traction as a subset of actor languages. With the rise of JavaScript, E’s notion of vats and non-blocking communication based on promises entered the mainstream. For implementations, the combination of dynamic typing, asynchronous message sending, and promise resolution pose new optimization challenges.

  This paper discusses these challenges and presents initial experiments for a Newspeak implementation based on the Truffle framework. Our implementation is on average 1.65x slower than Java on a set of 14 benchmarks. Initial optimizations improve the performance of asynchronous messages and reduce the cost of encapsulation on microbenchmarks by about 2x. Parallel actor benchmarks further show that the system scales based on the workload characteristics. Thus, we conclude that Truffle is a promising platform also for communicating event-loop languages.},

Xabstract = {Recent advances in formal verification techniques enabled the implementation of distributed systems with machine-checked proofs. While results are encouraging, the importance of distributed systems warrants a large scale evaluation of the results and verification practices.This paper thoroughly analyzes three state-of-the-art, formally verified implementations of distributed systems: Iron-Fleet, Verdi, and Chapar. Through code review and testing, we found a total of 16 bugs, many of which produce serious consequences, including crashing servers, returning incorrect results to clients, and invalidating verification guarantees. These bugs were caused by violations of a wide-range of assumptions on which the verified components relied. Our results revealed that these assumptions referred to a small fraction of the trusted computing base, mostly at the interface of verified and unverified components. Based on our observations, we have built a testing toolkit called PK, which focuses on testing these parts and is able to automate the detection of 13 (out of 16) bugs.},

@article{Greenman2019jfp,
  abstract = {A sound gradual type system ensures that untyped components of a program can never break the guarantees of statically typed components. This assurance relies on runtime checks, which in turn impose performance overhead in proportion to the frequency and nature of interaction between typed and untyped components. The literature on gradual typing lacks rigorous descriptions of methods for measuring the performance of gradual type systems. This gap has consequences for the implementors of gradual type systems and developers who use such systems. Without systematic evaluation of mixed-typed programs, implementors cannot precisely determine how improvements to a gradual type system affect performance. Developers cannot predict whether adding types to part of a program will significantly degrade (or improve) its performance. This paper presents the first method for evaluating the performance of sound gradual type systems. The method quantifies both the absolute performance of a gradual type system and the relative performance of two implementations of the same gradual type system. To validate the method, the paper reports on its application to 20 programs and 3 implementations of Typed Racket.},

abstract = {Program verification is a tool for the development of software that is free from defects and satisfies its functional specification. It suffers from two issues that have already been addressed in the field of type systems. First, it has a rigid focus on full-program verification. Also, it provides weak support for "partial" verification, relying on unproven lemmas that may lead to unsound runtime behavior. These issues are also present in Dafny, a verification-first programming language with full support for expressive pre-conditions and post-conditions that must be verified statically. Inspired by recent research on the field of gradual program verification in the Coq proof assistant, in this paper we present a first proposal for progressive verification in Dafny by presenting a minimal proof-of-concept implementation. Progressive verification means that programmers can use a new keyword to specify post-conditions that are assumed to be true during verification, but that will be tested at runtime by automatically-generated checks. We argue that our approach is correct by construction, by relying on the architecture of Dafny itself, and we also discuss several issues regarding the threats to the proposed approach as well as perspectives for further development.},

Xabstract = {In the last couple of years several dynamically-typed,
                  object-oriented programming languages have been
                  equipped with optional static type checkers. This
                  typically requires these languages to be extended
                  with a downcast operator, which is a common operator
                  in statically-typed languages but not in
                  dynamically-typed languages. Our objective is to
                  investigate an approach for static type checking of
                  object-oriented languages that does not require such
                  an additional downcast operator. We systematically
                  weaken the rules for static type checking to avoid
                  reporting errors that can be resolved using downcast
                  operators. This leads to an approach similar to
                  quasi-static typing that enables to make type
                  annotations stricter in a gradual way. These static
                  type checking rules can be applied to
                  dynamically-typed languages by interpreting the
                  dynamic type as the top of the subtype
                  relation. Based on these ideas we have implemented a
                  static type checker for the dynamically-typed,
                  object-oriented language POOSL without introducing a
                  downcast operator. Practical experiences with this
                  type checker indicate that it is useful for early
                  validation.}
