abstract = {This paper introduces the Savina benchmark suite for actor-oriented programs. Our goal is to provide a standard benchmark suite that enables researchers and application developers to compare different actor implementations and identify those that deliver the best performance for a given use-case. The benchmarks in Savina are diverse, realistic, and represent compute (rather than I/O) intensive applications. They range from popular micro-benchmarks to classical concurrency problems to applications that demonstrate various styles of parallelism. Implementations of the benchmarks on various actor libraries are made publicly available through an open source release. This will allow other developers and researchers to compare the performance of their actor libraries on these common set of benchmarks.},

abstract = "Any non-trivial concurrent system warrants synchronisation, regardless of the concurrency model. Actor-based concurrency serialises all computations in an actor through asynchronous message passing. In contrast, lock-based concurrency serialises some computations by following a lockâ€“unlock protocol for accessing certain data. Both systems require sound reasoning about pointers and aliasing to exclude data-races. If actor isolation is broken, so is the single-thread-of-control abstraction. Similarly for locks, if a datum is accessible outside of the scope of the lock, the datum is not governed by the lock. In this paper we discuss how to balance aliasing and synchronisation. In previous work, we defined a type system that guarantees data-race freedom of actor-based concurrency and lock-based concurrency. This paper extends this work by the introduction of two programming constructs; one for decoupling isolation and synchronisation and one for constructing higher-level atomicity guarantees from lower-level synchronisation. We focus predominantly on actors, and in particular the Encore programming language, but our ultimate goal is to define our constructs in such a way that they can be used both with locks and actors, given that combinations of both models occur frequently in actual systems. We discuss the design space, provide several formalisations of different semantics and discuss their properties, and connect them to case studies showing how our proposed constructs can be useful. We also report on an on-going implementation of our proposed constructs in Encore."

  abstract = {Communicating Event-Loop Languages similar to E and AmbientTalk are recently gaining more traction as a subset of actor languages. With the rise of JavaScript, Eâ€™s notion of vats and non-blocking communication based on promises entered the mainstream. For implementations, the combination of dynamic typing, asynchronous message sending, and promise resolution pose new optimization challenges.

  This paper discusses these challenges and presents initial experiments for a Newspeak implementation based on the Truffle framework. Our implementation is on average 1.65x slower than Java on a set of 14 benchmarks. Initial optimizations improve the performance of asynchronous messages and reduce the cost of encapsulation on microbenchmarks by about 2x. Parallel actor benchmarks further show that the system scales based on the workload characteristics. Thus, we conclude that Truffle is a promising platform also for communicating event-loop languages.},

@article{Marr-taxonomy,
  Xabstract = {The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model is a parallel programming model that aims to improve programmer productivity while at the same time aiming for high performance. The main premise of PGAS is that a globally shared address space improves productivity, but that a distinction between local and remote data accesses is required to allow performance optimizations and to support scalability on large-scale parallel architectures. To this end, PGAS preserves the global address space while embracing awareness of non-uniform communication costs.

  Today, about a dozen languages exist that adhere to the PGAS model. This survey proposes a definition and a taxonomy along four axes: how parallelism is introduced, how the address space is partitioned, how data is distributed among the partitions and finally how data is accessed across partitions. Our taxonomy reveals that today's PGAS languages focus on distributing regular data and distinguish only between local and remote data access cost, whereas the distribution of irregular data and the adoption of richer data access cost models remain open challenges.},

abstract = {We address the following questions for object-oriented programming:What is it?What are its goals?What are its origins?What are its paradigms?What are its design alternatives?What are its models of concurrency?What are its formal computational models?What comes after object-oriented programming?Starting from software engineering goals, we examine the origins and paradigms of object-oriented programming, explore its language design alternatives, consider its models of concurrency, and review its mathematical models to make them accessible to nonmathematical readers. Finally, we briefly speculate on what may come after object-oriented programming and conclude that it is a robust component-based modeling paradigm that is both effective and fundamental.
