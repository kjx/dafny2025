	Abstract = {Inheritance is well-known and accepted as a fundamental mechanism
   for reuse in object-oriented languages.
Unfortunately, the main variants\,---\,single inheritance, multiple inheritance,
and mixin inheritance\,---\,all suffer
from conceptual and practical problems related to software reuse and robustness
with respect to changes. In a
rst part of this thesis, we identify and illustrate these problems.
To overcome these problems, we then present traits, a simple compositional model
that extends single
inheritance. A trait is essentially a (parameterized) set of methods; it serves
as a behavioral building block
for classes and is the primitive unit of code reuse. We develop a formal model
of traits that establishes how
traits can be composed to form other traits or classes, and we describe how we
implemented traits in Squeak
Smalltalk by bootstrapping a new language kernel.
We present our experimental validation in which we apply traits to refactor
parts of the Smalltalk kernel and
library, and we develop a programming methodology around the usage of traits and
the trait browser, the tool
that we implemented to take full advantage of the availability of traits in the
Squeak programming environment.},

	Abstract = {Traits are an object-oriented programming language construct
that allow groups of methods to be named and reused
in arbitrary places in an inheritance hierarchy. Classes can
use methods from traits as well as defining their own methods
and instance variables. Traits thus enable a new style
of programming, in which traits rather than classes are the
primary unit of reuse. However, the additional sub-structure
provided by traits is always optional: a class written using
traits can also be viewed as a flat collection of methods,
with no change in its semantics.
This paper describes the tool that supports these two alternate
views of a class, called the traits browser, and the
programming methodology that we are starting to develop
around the use of traits.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a new technique for organizing software which has been used successfully by the Xerox Star 8010 workstation. The workstation (WS) software is written in an ``object-oriented'' style: it can be viewed as a system of inter-communicating objects of different object types. Most of the WS software considers object types to be constructed by assembling more primitive abstractions called traits. A trait is a characteristic of an object, and is expressed as a set of operations which may be applied to objects carrying that trait. The traits model of subclassing generalizes the SIMULA-67 model by permitting multiple inheritance paths. This paper describes the relationship of WS software to the traits model and then describes the model itself.},

	Abstract = {Traits are a programming language technology that promote the
reuse of methods between unrelated classes. This paper reports
on a refactoring of the Smalltalk collections classes using traits.
The original collection classes contained much duplication of code;
traits let us remove all of it. We also found places where the protocols
of the collections lacked uniformity; traits allowed us to correct
these non-uniformities without code duplication. Traits also make
it possible to reuse fragments of collection code outside of the existing
hierarchy; for example, they make it easy to convert other
collection-like things into true collections. Our refactoring reduced
the number of methods in the collection classes by approximately
10 per cent. More importantly, understandability maintainability
and reusability of the code were significantly improved.},

@inproceedings{transformational-patterns,
	abstract = {We propose three extensions to patterns and pattern matching in Haskell. The first, pattern guards, allows the guards of a guarded equation to match patterns and bind variables, as well as to test boolean condition. For this we introduce a natural generalization of guard expressions to guard qualifiers.

A frequently-occurring special case is that a function should be applied to a matched value, and the result of this is to be matched against another pattern. For this we introduce a syntactic abbreviation, transformational patterns, that is particularly useful when dealing with views. These proposals can be implemented with very modest syntactic and implementation cost. They are upward compatible with Haskell; all existing programs will continue to work.

We also offer a third, much more speculative proposal, which provides the transformational-pattern construct with additional power to explicitly catch pattern match failure.

We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed extension by several examples, in particular, we compare our proposal with views, and we also discuss the use of the new patterns in combination with equational reasoning.

	abstract = {ALGOL 68 is a language with a lot of {"history."} The reader will hear of discord, resignations, unreadable documents, a minority report, and all manner of politicking. But although ALGOL 68 was produced by a committee (and an unruly one at that), the language itself is no camel. Indeed, the rigorous application of the principle of {"orthogonality"} makes it one of the cleanest languages around, as I hope to show. Moreover, when the language came to be revised, the atmosphere was quite different, enabling a much more robust and readable defining document to be produced in a spirit of true cooperation. There are some lessons here for future language design efforts, but I am not optimistic that they have been learned.},
